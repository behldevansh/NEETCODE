// Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in h hours.

// Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

// Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

// Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours
